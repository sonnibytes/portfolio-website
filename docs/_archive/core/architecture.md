Let me continue with the template tags file for the core app and then provide a summary of the work we've done:

Now, let's create the necessary includes files for our template tags to work properly:

## Summary of Core App Development

I've created a comprehensive foundation for the core app of your ML DEVLOG portfolio site with a futuristic HUD-style interface. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished:

### Models
1. **Core Models**: We've established several models:
   - `CorePage`: For dynamic pages like privacy policy, terms, etc.
   - `Skill`: For showcasing your technical skills with visual ratings
   - `Education`: To display your educational background
   - `Experience`: For your work history
   - `Contact`: To handle contact form submissions
   - `SocialLink`: For connecting your social media profiles

### Views
1. **Class-based Views**: We've implemented modern Django class-based views:
   - `HomeView`: For your landing page with featured projects and posts
   - `AboutView`: To present professional profile and skills
   - `ContactView`: With form handling for inquiries
   - `ResumeView`: For your CV presentation
   - `CorePageView`: For dynamic pages created from the admin panel
   - Error handling views

### URLs
1. **URL Configuration**: Organized URL patterns for all core pages with appropriate naming conventions

### Templates
1. **Base Templates**: Created base templates for all pages following the futuristic HUD design
2. **Page Templates**: Detailed templates for each view with consistent styling
3. **Template Tags**: Custom template tags to easily render complex UI components like:
   - Radar charts for skills visualization
   - Terminal-style text boxes
   - Progress bars and skill indicators
   - Timeline elements for experience and education
   - Tech badges and hexagon components
   - Data grids for visual effects

### CSS
1. **Comprehensive Styling**: Modern CSS with a consistent futuristic HUD theme:
   - Base styles for the entire site
   - Page-specific styles for home, about, contact, resume
   - Components like cards, tech frames, and more
   - Visual elements like hexagons, glowing effects, and scanning animations
   - Responsive design for all screens

### JavaScript
1. **Interactive Components**: Engaging JavaScript functionality:
   - Terminal typing effects
   - Data visualizations (radar charts, data grids, etc.)
   - Skill bars with animation on scroll
   - Form validation with visual feedback
   - Social icons animations
   - Timeline reveal animations
   - Table of contents generation
   - Image lightbox functionality

### Included Files
1. **Admin Customization**: Enhanced Django admin for easier content management
2. **Context Processors**: Global context variables accessible throughout templates
3. **Template Includes**: Reusable template components for consistency

## Architecture Benefits

The architecture we've created has several advantages:

1. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns with models, views, and templates
2. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new pages or features
3. **DRY Principle**: Reusable components via template tags
4. **Performance**: Optimized JavaScript with lazy loading of animations
5. **Responsive Design**: Works well on all devices
6. **Admin Friendly**: Content can be managed through the Django admin interface
7. **Consistent Design**: The futuristic HUD theme is applied consistently

## Next Steps

To complete the setup of your core app, you'll need to:

1. **Create migrations**: Run `python manage.py makemigrations core` followed by `python manage.py migrate`
2. **Set up static files**: Make sure your settings.py has proper static files configuration
3. **Register template tags**: Add the core_tags to your INSTALLED_APPS to make them available
4. **Add media handling**: Configure media files for uploads in settings.py

Once this is done, you'll have a fully functional core app with a futuristic HUD-themed design that integrates seamlessly with your blog (ML DEVLOG) and projects apps. The design is consistent with the ML DEVLOG Style Files we discussed earlier.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail or make any adjustments to what we've created?
